# Spectral-Embedding-of-Graphs-Project
This project showcases a visual representation for spectral embedding of graphs.
[This](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~asandryh/papers/icassp13a.pdf) article explains the relation between this and fourier transforms.
[This](https://csustan.csustan.edu/~tom/Lecture-Notes/Clustering/GraphLaplacian-tutorial.pdf) is a bit easier to understand slide explanation of what the algorithm does.
Finally is [this](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/sgta/SpectTut.pdf) powerpoint by Daniel Spielman from Yale which was recommended as a good source.
