# Spectral-Embedding-of-Graphs-Project
This project showcases a visual representation for spectral embedding of graphs.
[This](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~asandryh/papers/icassp13a.pdf) article explains the relation between this and fourier transforms.  
[This](https://csustan.csustan.edu/~tom/Lecture-Notes/Clustering/GraphLaplacian-tutorial.pdf) is a bit easier to understand slide explanation of what the algorithm does.  
Finally is [this](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/sgta/SpectTut.pdf) powerpoint by Daniel Spielman from Yale which was recommended as a good source.  

We use [
Randomized Incremental Construction of Delaunay and Voronoi Diagrams](http://www.wias-berlin.de/people/si/course/files/Guibas92-RandomizeIncr.pdf) for Delaunay triangulation. (Incremental algorithm), thanks to [Johannes Diemke](https://github.com/jdiemke/delaunay-triangulator).
